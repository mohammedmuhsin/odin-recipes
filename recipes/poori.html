    <h1>Poori</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/recipe images/poori.jpg" alt="poori image" width="960" height="600">
    <p>Puri (sometimes spelled as poori) is a deep-fried bread made from unleavened whole-wheat flour that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is eaten for breakfast or as a snack or light meal. It is usually served with a savory curry or bhaji, as in puri bhaji, but may also be eaten with sweet dishes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>wheat</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, mix together 3 cups whole wheat flour (360 grams), 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon oil (optional) in a large bowl. For more crispy puri, you can add ¼ cup fine rava (sooji or semolina).</li>
        <li>Add just a bit of water at a time as you begin to form the dough, making sure to not oversaturate the mixture.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough with a wooden spoon or your hands, or use a standing mixer. Again, add only a splash or two of water at a time as you work.</li>
        <li>Continue to knead until you form a stiff, tight dough. It should not be soft like a roti or a bread loaf. You can add about ¾ to 1 cup of water in total.Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>When ready to use, divide the dough into about 30 small or 25 medium pieces, and roll each into a tight ball.</li>
        <li>Next, use the palm of your hand to lightly flatten the dough ball, and then apply a bit of oil to the entire surface. This helps the bread fry evenly and rise properly, without the need to dust with flour first (which runs the risk of creating burnt flour particles in your oil).</li>
        <li>Use a rolling pin to roll the poori dough evenly into circles that aren’t too thick or too thin. Ideally, you want them to be about ¼ inch thick.</li>
        <li>Then place the rolled poori on a plate, and loosely cover with a clean kitchen towel so that they don’t dry out.</li>
